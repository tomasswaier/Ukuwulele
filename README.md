MY REASONING BEHIND THERE BEING ALL FILES IS THAT ANDROID STUDIO WAS BEING VERY ANNOYING WITH VCS AND AFTER 1 H OF DEBUGGING I RAGEQUIT AND MADE IT IN CMD

Audio Player app that automatically loads all audiofiles from downloads/audiobooks/\*\* and presents them as choices for listening . After clicking on any audiofile it opens it in new window and you can listen to it .

Purpose behind this app is that I couldn't find android audioplayer that wouldn't have limitations on audiolenght and at the same time could save my progress on listening.

Updates :

added back and forth buttons

fixed seekBar

added indicators of current time and the duration of whole file

todo :
add downloader
