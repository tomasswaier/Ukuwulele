Audio Player app that automatically loads all audiofiles from downloads/audiobooks/** and presents them as choices for listening . After clicking on any audiofile it opens it in new window and you can listen to it . 

Purpose behind this app is that I couldn't find android audioplayer that wouldn't have limitations on audiolenght and at the same time could save my progress on listening.
